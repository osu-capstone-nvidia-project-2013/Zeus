Progress: -Depth of field is working at a somewhat satisfactory level, some tweaking is needed. 
          -Transferring motion blur over wasn't as smooth as it hoped to be
          -So far, refactoring of code has proved to be beneficial, allowing the ease of APEX/PhsyX integration
                    + What has been succesfully added:
                      - Object loader
                      - Render to full screen quad
                      - Sky box
                      - Camera controls

Todo:     -Continue push to add features to complete the refactoring.
          -Figure out issues with motion blur

Blockers: Nothing we haven't gotten through


=============
4/4/2013

Progress: Motion Blur side project working

Todo: Begin to plan code refactor for ease of implementation of APEX/PhysX features 


=============

3/14/2013

Progress: Created a side project for implementing the motion blur effect from GPU Gems 3, should complete soon

Todo: Finish motion blur and continue working on bokeh filter and depth of field. 

Blockers: (NSFW sorta) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUjh9Id6Id8

=============

3/7/2013

Progress: Have a good idea for motion blur, started implementation

Todo: Complete motion blur

Blockers: Other classes having projects and midterms this week

=============
2/14/2013

Progress: Able to have multiple textures on a given object

Todo: Convert how vertices are going to be inserted to keep it to one type as opposed to multiple

Blockers: none



=============
2/4/2013

Progress: Working on creating a rope in phsyx


=============
1/24/2013

Progress: Added point light, issues with our basic shader resolved.

Todo: Omni-directional shadow map

Blockers: None thus far


=============
11/29/2012

Progress: We have normal mapping. 

Todo: Do environment and shadow mapping. Also, apply some sort of sorting to our objects for rendering. And game timing

Blockers: None


=============
11/15/2012

Progress: We have blending, but are having issues with alpha killing. Texturing has also been worked on and near complete

Todo: Continue to refactor code in order to maintain multiple objects.

Blockers: None 


=============
11/8/2012

Progress: Phong shading is nearing completion. 

Todo: Continue modulizing our program, finish phong, and start texturing.

Blockers: The way our code is now, we are not able to transform multiple objects. The one spot in code where we are
          rendering the objects is too specific and need to redesign it where we have something such as:
          
          setRotate()
          setTrans()
          finalMatrix()
          setConstantBuff()
          
          render(&vBuffer, &iBuffer)

=============
11/1/2012

Progress: Circle created (without normal). Translation and rotation (over time) added to both a triangle and circle. 
Added flat and smooth shading. 

Todo: Add given normal to circle, create a sphere.

Blockers: Figuring out how to connect sphere coordinates together 


=============
10/25/2012

Progress: Created a window and a simple shader to draw a plain triangle

Todo: Create rectangle, circle, and sphere then do some transforms with the vertex shader.

Blockers: None at this point.
