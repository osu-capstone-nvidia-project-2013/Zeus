=============
1/24/2013

Progress: Added point light, issues with our basic shader resolved.

Todo: Omni-directional shadow map

Blockers: None thus far


=============
11/29/2012

Progress: We have normal mapping. 

Todo: Do environment and shadow mapping. Also, apply some sort of sorting to our objects for rendering. And game timing

Blockers: None


=============
11/15/2012

Progress: We have blending, but are having issues with alpha killing. Texturing has also been worked on and near complete

Todo: Continue to refactor code in order to maintain multiple objects.

Blockers: None 


=============
11/8/2012

Progress: Phong shading is nearing completion. 

Todo: Continue modulizing our program, finish phong, and start texturing.

Blockers: The way our code is now, we are not able to transform multiple objects. The one spot in code where we are
          rendering the objects is too specific and need to redesign it where we have something such as:
          
          setRotate()
          setTrans()
          finalMatrix()
          setConstantBuff()
          
          render(&vBuffer, &iBuffer)

=============
11/1/2012

Progress: Circle created (without normal). Translation and rotation (over time) added to both a triangle and circle. 
Added flat and smooth shading. 

Todo: Add given normal to circle, create a sphere.

Blockers: Figuring out how to connect sphere coordinates together 


=============
10/25/2012

Progress: Created a window and a simple shader to draw a plain triangle

Todo: Create rectangle, circle, and sphere then do some transforms with the vertex shader.

Blockers: None at this point.
