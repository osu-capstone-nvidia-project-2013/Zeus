Progress: 
  See issues.

Todo: 
  Get PhysX/APEX loaded and attached to a model
  from Maya. 

Issues: 
  APEX, repx, everything.




--- 3/7/12 ---
Progress: 
  Hacking away at repx loading.

Todo: 
  Get repx loaded and attached to a model
  from Maya.

Issues: 
  Lack of information about loading repx.





--- 2/14/12 ---
Progress: 
  Hacking away at repx loading.

Todo: 
  Get repx loaded and attached to a model
  from Maya.

Issues: 
  Lack of information about loading repx.





--- 2/14/12 ---
Progress: 
  Created cloth in Maya and Max using the PhysX plugin.
  Created destructible objects using PhysXLab. 

Todo: 
  Rope (will be the same as cloth in Maya)
  More more stuff in Maya and PhysXLab. 

Issues: 
  Exporting as .repx from Maya/Max.
  Loading .repx into the engine.  




--- 2/1/12 ---
Progress: 
  PhysX hooked in, boxes shooting, cheating the game timing for now. 

Todo: 
  Point light shadow map, still. 

Issues: 
  Omni-directional light shadow mapping is headache inducing.  




--- 2/1/12 ---
Progress: 
  PhysX hooked in! 

Todo: 
  Fix game timing.

Issues: 
  Still having the flipped mapping in the reflection of the sphere.
  Omni-directional light shadow mapping still not working properly. 




--- 1/24/12 ---
Progress: 
  Omni-directional light.

Todo: 
  Finish shadow map for omni-directional light.

Issues: 
  Still having the flipped mapping in the reflection of the sphere.





--- 1/17/12 ---
Progress: 
  Dynamic environment mapping, particle systems, instancing, frustum culling,
  multiple light source shadow mapping, font engine, a distance to object check 
  that enables/disables dynamic environment mapping, fixed alt-enter issue. 

Todo: 
  Omni-directional light shadow mapping.

Issues: 
  Still having the flipped mapping in the reflection of the sphere. PIX isn't 
  allowing debugging on a D3D11 TexCube. It may be best to move on. 




--- 1/10/12 ---
Progress: 
  Shadow mapping, environment mapping, tons o' stuff.

Todo: 
  Multiple dynamic cube mapping targets, multiple light source shadow mapping,
  omni-directional light shadow mapping, font engine, particles (pretty much done).

Issues: 
  Alt-Enter causes a screen refresh error, probably an easy fix. 




--- 12/6/12 ---
Progress: 
  Fixed z-buffer

Todo: 
  Finish environment mapping.
  Continue work on shadow mapping and game timing.
  Finish milestone 2.

Blockers: 
  Finals, and not understanding certain directx protocols. 




--- 11/29/12 ---
Progress: 
  Finished normal mapping. 

Todo: 
  Finish environment mapping.
  Continue work on shadow mapping and game timing.
  Finish milestone 2.

Blockers: 
  Normal mapping was difficult, but Patrick helped us through it.




--- 11/15/12 ---
Progress: 
  Still working on shadow mapping and game timing.

Todo: 
  Finish shadow mapping and game timing.
  Finish milestone 2.

Blockers: 
  None.




--- 11/08/12 ---
Progress: 
  Milestone 1 completed. 
  Phong shading also done. 
  Shadow mapping is about half-completed. 
  Game timing is about a quarter of the way done. 

Todo: 
  Finish shadow mapping and game timing.
  Work on; diffuse texturing, blending + alpha kill, normal mapping, and environment mapping.

Blockers: 
  None.




--- 11/01/12 ---
Progress: 
  Window, triangle, quad, circle, transformations, and shaders completed. 

Todo: 
  Sphere.

Blockers: 
  None.
